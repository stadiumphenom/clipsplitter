# ðŸ“˜ ClipSplitter â€” Architecture & Value Overview

## ðŸš€ What It Does
ClipSplitter allows users to upload full-length videos and instantly split them into smaller mini-clips using either:

- **Equal-length** segments (e.g. every 5s)
- **Scene-based** detection (FFmpeg scene threshold)

Clips can be downloaded:
- Individually (`clip_001.mp4`, `clip_002.mp4`, ...)
- Or bundled as a `.zip`
